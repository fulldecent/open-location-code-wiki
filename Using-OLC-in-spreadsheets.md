Being able to work with Open Location Code in spreadsheets is, for most people, probably the easiest method to work with them in bulk.

This page explains how you can access the Open Location Code functions from Excel, LibreOffice or Google Spreadsheets.

VBA script and instructions are checked into github [here](https://github.com/google/open-location-code/tree/master/visualbasic).

LibreOffice does sometimes have problems. This may be due to slightly unreliable VBA support in some versions.
