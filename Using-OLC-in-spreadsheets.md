Being able to work with Open Location Code in spreadsheets is, for most people, probably the easiest method to work with them in bulk.

This page explains how you can access the Open Location Code functions from Excel, LibreOffice or Google Spreadsheets.

## Excel/LibreOffice

VBA script and instructions are checked into github [here](https://github.com/google/open-location-code/tree/master/visualbasic).

LibreOffice does sometimes have problems. This may be due to slightly unreliable VBA support in some versions.

## Google Sheets

The functionality of Google Sheets can be expanded using add-ons. An add-on for Plus Codes has been created.

Click on [this link to install the Plus Codes add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plus-codes/fgkmcjicocppedogpabhengnodlckfag). It will open a new spreadsheet and add the Plus Code functions. These functions are now available to all your Google Sheets.

### Here's one we made earlier

[Here is a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CKYWqBHUNVJfAN43psdud4dcDYTcsBLOALCnbJEbSjo/edit#gid=0) that shows the new functions you can use. Open the spreadsheet, then choose "File -> Make a copy" to get a copy that you can edit.

Note to maintainers: The library that we use above is defined in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yvew4fPhqG1UmCkGj28dM6G-0vzst_VuT7_8d048in8/edit). You can see the `encoderange()` function here and any other functions provided.
